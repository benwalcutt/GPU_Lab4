1. The inputs were chosen to increment the size of the matrix equally among test cases so that a rate could be obtained. The kernel performs roughly N*N*50 floating point operations during its execution. The result is divided by the time it takes the kernel to process providing the FLOPS which is then transformed to GLOPS. It appears that the kernel itself executes at ~43 GFLOPS.

2. The overhead initially consumes a large portion of the computational time; however, it begins to decrease as the number of operations required to perform the kernel increase. Since the number of calculations grows faster than the number of elements required to move between device and host, the overhead slowly decreases with time.
